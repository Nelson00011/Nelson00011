# Nelson's Github
I am a fullstack software engineer, graduate of [Hackbright](https://hackbrightacademy.com/) Coding Boot Camp (March 2023). 
As a developer, I enjoy applications that use a clean aesthetic to improve user functionality. 
I love solution oriented, communication driven teams that empower people and support diversity.
